    - graphql-request: we are stuck at version 5.1.0 because 5.2.0 has a typescript bug
                       see https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/issues/9046

    - react-hotkeys-hook: we are stuck at version 3.4.7 because 4.X is not working well.
                          Need more experimenting.
